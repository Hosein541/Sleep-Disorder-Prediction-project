## Project Overview:
The main objective of this data science project is to analyze various lifestyle and medical variables of individuals, such as age, BMI, physical activity, sleep duration, blood pressure, etc., and use this information to predict the occurrence and type of sleep disorder they may experience. Sleep disorders, like Insomnia and Sleep Apnea, can have significant impacts on an individual's health and overall well-being. By identifying individuals at risk of sleep disorders, appropriate interventions and treatments can be provided to improve their sleep quality and overall health.

## Summary and Conclusion
In this project, I focused on predicting sleep disorders using a variety of data preprocessing and machine learning techniques. The steps and methodologies employed are as follows:

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handling Missing Values: Missing values were filled in a way that preserved the distribution of the data, maintaining the integrity of the dataset.
Categorical Encoding and Feature Engineering:

Age Categorization: The age of individuals was converted into categorical variables to enhance model performance.
Occupation Simplification: The occupation feature, which had many unique values, was simplified to reduce complexity.
Blood Pressure Columns: The single blood pressure column was split into two separate columns for more detailed analysis.
BMI Categorization: The BMI index was converted from three categories into two for better model accuracy.
Data Visualization:

Appropriate visualizations were created to explore and understand the data patterns and relationships.
Data Standardization and Labeling:

Data standardization was performed to normalize the features, and label encoding was applied to convert categorical variables into numerical format.
Model Training and Evaluation:

An XGBoost (XGB) model was trained on the processed dataset, achieving an accuracy of 94.5%.
These steps ensured a comprehensive analysis and model training process, leading to a highly accurate prediction model for sleep disorders.
